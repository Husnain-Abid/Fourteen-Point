              <li>The form of the future constitution should be federal, with the residuary powers vested in the
                provinces.</li>
              <li> A uniform measure of autonomy shall be granted to all provinces.</li>
              <li>All legislatures in the country and other elected bodies shall be constituted on the definite
                principle of adequate and effective representation of minorities in every province without reducing the
                majority in any province to minority of even equality.</li>
              <li>In the Central Legislature council, Muslim representation shall not be less than one-third</li>
              <li>Representation of communal groups shall continue to be by separate electorates: provided that it shall be open to any community, at any time, to abandon its separate electorate in favour of joint electorate.</li>

              <li>Any territorial distribution that might at any time be necessary shall not in any way affect the Muslim majority in Punjab, Bengal, and NWFP provinces.</li>
              <li>Full religious liberty shall be guaranteed to all communities.</li>
              <li>One-third representation shall be given to Muslims in both central and provincial cabinets.</li>
              <li>No bill or resolution shall be passed in any legislature if three-fourths of the members of any community in that body oppose the bill.</li>
              <li>Sindh should be separated from Bombay to a province.</li>
              <li>Reforms should be introduced in the NWFP and Balochistan on the same footings as in the other provinces.</li>
              <li>Muslims should be given an adequate share in all services, having due regard to the requirement of efficiency.</li>
              <li>The Constitution should embody adequate safeguards for the protection of Muslim culture, education, language, religion, and personal laws, as well as for Muslim charitable institutions.</li>
              <li>No change will be made in the constitution without the consent of the province.</li>
